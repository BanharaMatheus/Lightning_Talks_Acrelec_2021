# Introduction
Automation of POS API endurance/stress tests.

## Setting environment up
1.Clone the repository on your local machine:
    ````
    git clone https://acrelecamericas.visualstudio.com/QA/_git/POS
    ````
    
2.Deploy virtualenv in your machine, based on Python 3.8.
   
3.Run the command:
    ````
     pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```` to install all the dependecies of the project.

4.If you are not in the office, you must activate the VPN, so the test script will be able to communicate with the POS and KDS.
